-- Fix permissions for stations table
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor if you get "permission denied" error

-- Grant full permissions to all roles
GRANT ALL ON TABLE stations TO anon;
GRANT ALL ON TABLE stations TO authenticated;
GRANT ALL ON TABLE stations TO service_role;
GRANT ALL ON TABLE stations TO postgres;

-- Drop existing restrictive policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow public read access to active stations" ON stations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow authenticated read access" ON stations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow authenticated update availability" ON stations;

-- Create more permissive policies
CREATE POLICY "Allow all operations for anon"
    ON stations
    FOR ALL
    TO anon
    USING (true)
    WITH CHECK (true);

CREATE POLICY "Allow all operations for authenticated"
    ON stations
    FOR ALL
    TO authenticated
    USING (true)
    WITH CHECK (true);

-- Alternatively, you can disable RLS temporarily for development
-- ALTER TABLE stations DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Verify permissions
